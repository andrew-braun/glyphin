# Task: Practice Vocabulary Expansion

- Start date: 2026-06-13
- Owner: Codex
- Status: planned

## Goal

Shift Glyphin lessons from one anchor plus a tiny support-word sample to a
practice-first model: each lesson should teach one anchor word and then give
learners at least ten fresh, decodable practice words or short phrases before
scored drills. Later lessons may also expose an optional extension set.

## Scope

- In scope:
  - Define the curriculum contract for anchor, core practice, and optional
    practice vocabulary.
  - Plan changes to Thai lesson authoring artifacts, runtime TypeScript data,
    delivery DTO mapping, and database publication.
  - Plan a rework of Lesson 1 so practice targets are not revealed before the
    learner has tried to decode them.
  - Identify validation rules that prevent future courses from regressing to
    too little practice.
- Out of scope:
  - Shipping the full vocabulary expansion in this planning pass.
  - Changing authentication, learner sync, or production deployment behavior.
  - Treating low-confidence or sensitive Thai items as final without review.

## Current Findings

- `src/lib/data/types.ts` already has `Lesson.vocabulary`, but it only supports
  `role: "anchor" | "support"` and no explicit practice tier.
- `src/lib/data/thai.ts` currently gives every Thai lesson exactly two support
  words through `supportingVocabularyByLessonId`.
- `src/lib/components/lesson/StepSameLettersNewWords.svelte` already has the
  right reveal pattern for transfer practice: the learner sees the word first,
  then checks pronunciation and meaning.
- `src/routes/learn/[id]/+page.svelte` inserts the transfer step only when
  support vocabulary exists.
- `src/lib/server/delivery-payload.ts` maps published DB vocabulary, but it
  currently accepts only `anchor` and `support` role keys.
- The database is already ahead of runtime: `curriculum.vocabulary_items`,
  `curriculum.vocabulary_segments`, and `curriculum.lesson_vocabulary` exist,
  and `lesson_vocabulary.role_key` is text rather than an enum. The DB can carry
  richer roles without a schema change.
- `docs/database-dto-spec.md` already describes `lesson_vocabulary` as supporting
  anchor, taught, review, and extension vocabulary, but the runtime and Thai
  docs have not caught up.

## Target Curriculum Contract

- Every lesson keeps exactly one featured anchor.
- Every standard lesson should have at least ten core practice targets that are
  decodable from prior lessons plus the current lesson's new graphemes and
  rules.
- Later lessons may add up to ten optional practice targets after the core set
  when the grapheme pool is large enough.
- Practice targets may be standalone words, high-frequency compounds, or short
  phrases.
- Nonsense or constructed targets are allowed only as a pressure-release valve
  for the earliest lessons, and must be clearly tagged as constructed so they do
  not pollute learned-word lists as ordinary vocabulary.
- Practice targets should be hidden from pre-practice lesson copy, rule examples,
  drill prompts, and answer options unless the learner has already attempted
  them in the transfer step.
- Rule examples should use the anchor, non-target examples, or already completed
  vocabulary. They should not accidentally reveal upcoming core practice words.

## Thai Lesson 1 Draft Inventory

Lesson 1 anchor remains:

- `มาก` — very / a lot

Candidate core practice set from known graphemes `ม`, `า`, `ก`:

- `มา` — to come
- `กา` — crow; also kettle/teapot or to mark/check
- `กาม` — sensuality
- `กาก` — residue, dregs; casual "trash/useless" slang
- `กก` — reeds; also to cuddle/incubate
- `กากมาก` — very bad / really trashy, casual
- `มามาก` — comes a lot / heavy flow, gloss should stay neutral
- `กามา` — sensuality or sensual matters, formal/poetic register
- review-needed slot 9: real phrase preferred; constructed target acceptable if
  tagged
- review-needed slot 10: real phrase preferred; constructed target acceptable if
  tagged

Sensitive-language guidance:

- Prefer toned-down glosses such as "sensuality" over explicit sexual phrasing.
- Avoid unnecessary body-product context for `มามาก`; keep the learner-facing
  note neutral.
- Label `กากมาก` as casual and potentially rude so it is useful without being
  normalized as polite speech.

## Step-By-Step Strategy

### 1. Establish The Durable Authoring Rule

- Update `docs/curriculum/authoring-framework.md` so "support word" evolves into
  a practice vocabulary model:
  - anchor: one featured lesson word;
  - core practice: minimum ten read-before-reveal targets;
  - optional practice: later extra targets for fluency and review;
  - constructed target: allowed only when marked and reviewed.
- Update `docs/curriculum/authoring-tools.md` to make lesson sequences and
  review packets report practice counts.
- Update `docs/curriculum/thai-reading-v1/lesson-sequence.md` so every row has a
  practice-vocabulary count target, not only "drill focus."
- Update `docs/curriculum/thai-reading-v1/db-ingestion-strategy.md` to state
  that Thai ingestion must populate all anchor, core practice, optional practice,
  and constructed/review metadata before publication.

### 2. Update The Data Contract

- Extend `LessonVocabularyEntry` in `src/lib/data/types.ts` to distinguish
  practice role and tier. Recommended shape:
  - `role: "anchor" | "practice"`;
  - `tier: "core" | "optional"` for practice entries;
  - `sourceType: "real" | "phrase" | "constructed"`;
  - `drillTarget: boolean`.
- Keep `anchorWord` for the current page contract, but ensure the anchor is also
  present in vocabulary when publication data is generated.
- Decide whether learned-word collection should include constructed targets. The
  conservative default is no: constructed targets should train decoding, not
  become saved vocabulary.

### 3. Align Delivery DTOs And Database Publication

- Update `docs/database-dto-spec.md` role-key examples to match the runtime
  contract: `anchor`, `practice_core`, `practice_optional`, and optionally
  `review`.
- Update `src/lib/server/delivery-payload.ts` so published payloads accept the
  new role keys and map them into runtime `LessonVocabularyEntry` values.
- Keep the DB schema unless implementation proves we need constraints; current
  `lesson_vocabulary.role_key text` and `metadata jsonb` are flexible enough.
- Store source/type metadata in `lesson_vocabulary.metadata` or
  `vocabulary_items.metadata` for constructed/sensitive/register notes.
- Add publication smoke checks that fail when a lesson has fewer than ten core
  practice targets, except for explicitly approved early-lesson exceptions.

### 4. Rework Static Thai Runtime Content

- Replace `supportingVocabularyByLessonId` with a practice vocabulary structure
  that can hold core and optional targets.
- Expand Lesson 1 first using the reviewed candidate pool above.
- Expand Lessons 2-13 by allowing each lesson to reuse all previously taught
  graphemes plus current graphemes. This keeps new lessons feeling cumulative
  and makes later practice pools much easier to fill.
- For later lessons, target:
  - one anchor;
  - ten core practice targets;
  - up to ten optional practice targets when quality is high enough.
- Keep transliteration, tone marking, segmentation, and context notes consistent
  with existing Thai lesson voice.

### 5. Prevent Practice Spoilers In The Lesson Flow

- Audit Lesson 1 before editing:
  - `rulesIntroduced[].examples`;
  - `drills[].prompt`;
  - `drills[].options`;
  - intro/breakdown/letters copy.
- Remove unrevealed practice targets from rule examples and drill options before
  the transfer step. For Lesson 1, `กา` currently appears in rule examples and
  `กาม` appears in a spot drill option; those should move out of pre-practice
  exposure if they become core practice targets.
- Keep the anchor visible throughout the lesson; it is the taught object, not a
  spoiler.
- After the practice step, drills may refer to already attempted practice words,
  but they should still test a fair, deterministic skill.

### 6. Upgrade The Transfer Practice UI For Larger Sets

- Keep the existing read-before-reveal interaction.
- Add pacing for 10-20 targets:
  - core/optional progress labels;
  - "continue core practice" and "optional extra practice" transitions;
  - compact completion summary;
  - no long scrolling list that reveals answers prematurely.
- Consider letting learners skip optional practice after the ten core targets.
- Preserve mobile ergonomics: one target at a time, stable button sizing, and no
  dense table of hidden answers.

### 7. Update Drills Around The New Vocabulary Model

- Keep scored drills short enough to finish, but source choices from practice
  targets that have already been attempted.
- Add drill authoring guidance:
  - match drills can use anchor and attempted practice targets;
  - spot drills should avoid using unseen core targets as distractors;
  - sound drills should prefer grapheme/rule transfer, not pure memorization.
- Add validation that any drill option matching a lesson's core practice target
  is not shown before that target is attempted in the flow.

### 8. Validate And Review

- Run static checks after implementation: `pnpm check`.
- Run `pnpm check:all` if SCSS, formatting, or lint-sensitive UI files change.
- Run `pnpm build` if delivery payloads, route data, or publication behavior
  changes.
- Manually walk Lesson 1 in `pnpm dev` to confirm:
  - practice words are not revealed early;
  - the transfer step shows at least ten core targets;
  - sensitive glosses are appropriately toned;
  - completion and known-word collection behave as intended.
- Have Thai content reviewed before treating low-frequency, slang, sensitive, or
  constructed targets as final shipped content.

## Implementation Order

1. Documentation and authoring-contract updates.
2. Runtime type update and mapper update.
3. Lesson 1 static data expansion plus spoiler audit.
4. Transfer-step UI pacing for ten-plus targets.
5. Thai Lessons 2-13 expansion.
6. DB/DTO spec and publication smoke-check updates.
7. Validation and manual lesson review.

## Progress

## Open Questions

- What should the two remaining Lesson 1 practice targets be after Thai review?
- Should constructed targets ever be stored in `knownWords`, or should they only
  count as decoding practice?
- Should optional practice be skippable by default, or only after a learner has
  demonstrated high accuracy?
- Do we want a hard validator that blocks every published lesson below ten core
  practice targets, or a warning with explicit exceptions for early lessons?

## Follow-Up

- Update `.ai/curriculum/thai-reading-v1.md` as the Thai-specific tracker for
  the expansion.
- Consider adding a reusable curriculum lint command once the first expanded
  lesson lands.
