# Lesson Flow Visual Sweep

- Start date: 2026-05-24
- Owner: GitHub Copilot
- Status: done

## Goal

Carry the finished lesson-complete visual direction into the real lesson flow so
intro, breakdown, letters, rules, same-letters transfer, drills, and completion
feel like one coherent learning experience.

## Scope

- In scope:
  - Confirm the redesigned completion screen is used by the real lesson route.
  - Apply the completion-page design language to earlier lesson steps: generous
    spacing, section accent stripes, a few solid callouts, and consistent dark
    surfaces.
  - Keep the same-letters transfer step integrated before drills.
  - Validate Svelte, TypeScript, SCSS, lint, build, markdown, and whitespace.
- Out of scope:
  - Changing lesson progression rules or completion timing.
  - Changing curriculum content, scoring behavior, auth, database, or persistence.
  - A full site-wide design-system extraction beyond the lesson flow.

## Constraints

- Preserve the linear lesson sequence and route-owned state machine.
- Keep step components presentational-first.
- Use lesson model data for letters, rules, support words, and drills.
- Maintain dark and light theme contrast for solid accent surfaces.

## Progress

- [x] Audit real lesson flow integration
- [x] Apply shared visual language to earlier steps
- [x] Update documentation and tracker notes
- [x] Validate

## Notes

- `StepComplete` is already rendered by `src/routes/learn/[id]/+page.svelte`, so
  the completion redesign is not preview-only.
- The real lesson route already includes `StepSameLettersNewWords` between rules
  and drills when support vocabulary exists.
- Added a shared `.lesson-accent-panel` utility for the accent-stripe treatment
  used across intro, breakdown, letters, rules, same-letters transfer, and drills.
- Made intro and breakdown anchor words solid teal callouts, the current-letter
  teaching card a solid sky callout, and the same-letters anchor card a solid
  mango callout.
- Updated primary and success button foregrounds to use the same contrast-safe
  solid accent foreground tokens as the callout cards.
- Solid accent contrast ratios after the sweep: primary/on-primary `7.13:1` AAA,
  sky/on-sky `6.58:1` AA, mango/on-mango `9.56:1` AAA, accent/on-accent
  `6.17:1` AA, and success/on-success `5.37:1` AA.
