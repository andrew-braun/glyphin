/**
 * Thai Language Curriculum Data
 *
 * This sequence rewrites the original curriculum around the frequency-first,
 * real-world reading strategy captured in docs/concept/approach-thai.md.
 * The order now starts with high-payoff words and grapheme chunks that unlock
 * menus, storefronts, simple adjectives, and everyday survival vocabulary.
 *
 * Stage groups progress as follows:
 *   Stage 1 - Core payoff words and the first high-frequency vowels
 *   Stage 2 - Market and movement words with reusable syllable frames
 *   Stage 3 - Before-vowels and tone marks taught through sight words
 *   Stage 4 - Sibilants, short vowels, and price/menu language
 *   Stage 5 - High-class survival words, silent carriers, and food lexicon
