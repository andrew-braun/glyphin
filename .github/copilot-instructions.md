# Glyphin Copilot Instructions

- This file is the repo-wide Copilot baseline. Path-specific rules live in `.github/instructions/*.instructions.md`.
- Also respect the nearest `AGENTS.md` when working in a subdirectory.
- Use `pnpm` with Node `24.15.0`.
- For every non-minor task, create and maintain a dated markdown spec/tracker in `.ai/` using `YYYY-MM-DD-short-description.md`. Minor tasks (quick style/layout tweaks, small bug fixes, copy edits) don't need one — just make the change.
- Do not stop for approval on minor changes; only pause when an unexpected complication arises or something needs clarification.
- Use `docs/` for durable reference documentation and `.ai/` for task-scoped tracking, temporary rollout plans, and backlog notes.
- Use `.ai/curriculum/<language>.md` as the central location for per-language curriculum progress and to-dos.
- For database or Supabase work, start with `docs/db.md`; use `docs/database-dto-spec.md` for the exact schema and DTO contract, and `supabase/migrations/*.sql` for the live implementation.
- Run `pnpm check` before finishing non-trivial changes.
- Use `pnpm check:all` when a change affects formatting, linting, aliases, or SCSS styling conventions.
- Use `pnpm lint` and `pnpm stylelint` for focused TypeScript, Svelte, and style validation.
- Run `pnpm build` when route behavior, metadata, env usage, or bundling changes.
- `pnpm db:content:refresh` is the default local curriculum workflow. It
  regenerates `supabase/seed.sql`, refreshes local Supabase content, restores
  local auth and learner state, and regenerates `.generated/` lesson
  publication artifacts.
- `pnpm db:reset` is for full local resets when you intentionally want to wipe
  learner and auth state as well as refresh lesson content.
- When architecture, tech choices, config, environment, deployment, or workflow assumptions change, update every relevant instruction file in the same change.
- Keep `src/routes` responsible for routing, route data, and metadata.
- Keep `src/lib/components` responsible for reusable rendering. Keep UI primitives domain-agnostic.
- Prefer Bits UI for reusable interactive primitives and composite controls wherever possible instead of hand-rolling accessibility behavior.
- For repeated interactive patterns, prefer app-owned wrappers in `src/lib/components/ui` that standardize the product API and styling on top of Bits UI.
- Use `@lucide/svelte` for UI icons. Import each icon from `@lucide/svelte/icons/<icon-name>`; do not use the package root barrel or approximate icons with punctuation in button labels.
- Treat `src/lib/data` as the canonical lesson-content source of truth and `src/lib/stores` as client-state and persistence boundaries.
- In Svelte 5, prefer `$derived` over `$effect` for computed state.
- Prefer runes-mode APIs over legacy patterns in new code.
- For new shared state or extracted reactive logic, prefer rune-powered `.svelte.ts` modules over classic stores unless a store contract is specifically required.
- Prefer SvelteKit remote functions for first-party typed client-server reads and mutations when they fit the feature and current framework support. Use `+server.ts` for true HTTP endpoints, webhooks, third-party integrations, or when remote functions are a poor fit.
- Treat props as read-only, prefer callback props for child-to-parent communication, and use `$bindable` only for intentional two-way APIs.
- Preserve accessible semantic HTML, descriptive titles, useful page copy, and human-readable URLs.
- Give learners usable tools, then let them try those tools in new contexts before revealing answers.
- Do not duplicate lesson content or create abstractions with only one speculative use.
- Use server-only SvelteKit modules for secrets, writes, or privileged data.
- If Supabase-backed auth or server data is added, use `@supabase/ssr`; never put admin credentials in client code.
- DB-backed runtime lesson delivery now targets Cloudflare Workers Static Assets via `@sveltejs/adapter-cloudflare`; do not treat the app as static-only when touching server-owned route reads.
- Preserve the database schema boundaries in future work: `curriculum` and `internal_api` stay private, `delivery` is the runtime content boundary, and `learner` is the RLS-protected learner-state boundary.
- In SCSS, prefer maximal nesting that follows the rendered HTML structure. BEM-style class names are fine, but styles should not be organized as flat `&__element` blocks when direct nested selectors can mirror the DOM. For same-element modifiers, prefer explicit selectors like `&.component--modifier`.
- Any work involving environment variables, auth, sessions, databases, secure routes, storage, or production secrets is high-risk and must be researched against current docs, designed conservatively, and explicitly signed off on before deployment.
- Never expose, log, serialize, or commit secrets. Verify public versus private env boundaries every time.
